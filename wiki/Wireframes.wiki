All pages will have this basic layout. The *header* and the *footer* will be the same on all the pages. The rest of the page's content goes in the *content* area.

*Header*

Contains:
   * Main *navigation menu*
   * *Name* of the website

*Footer*

Contains:
   * *Links* from the navigation menu
   * *Privacy policy* and other legal stuff, if needed

*Elements*
   # Short *description* of how the app works - so the users won't need to go through the tedious process of reading through the *About* page
   # *Search box* - this is where the user inputs the query


== Results ==
*Wireframe*
[https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cv5_ktHKXoE/TyRSeLhMK_I/AAAAAAAAJok/-GWDtgOywj0/s1054/results.png]

In the case that a query returns *more than one result*, this page is shown.

*Elements*
   # Breadcrumbs & stuff - maybe not in the _Search results page_?
   # *Search box* - provides easy access to the search function
   # *Result* set - the results of the query grouped by the level they're on

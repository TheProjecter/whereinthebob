== Home ==

All pages will have this basic layout. The *header* and the *footer* will be the same on all the pages. The rest of the page's content goes in the *content* area.

*Elements*
  * Header
   # *Name* of the website
   # *Tagline* / Short *description* of how the app works - so the users won't need to go through the tedious process of reading through the *About* page
   # *Search box* - this is where the user inputs the query

  * Footer
   * *Links* for the navigation menu
   * *Privacy policy* and other legal stuff, if needed

== Results/Directory ==
[https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-C4z3H-0mhic/TzFIFxX30GI/AAAAAAAAJrY/0zz7By-ncFY/s546/results.png]

The pages *Results* and *Directory* share the same design: a list of all the levels, and for each one of them, a list of rooms. If a query returns more than one result, this page is shown with the list of matching rooms. In the case of the *Directory* page, all the levels are listed.

*Elements*
   # *Query* - the searched term
   # *Result* set - the results of the query grouped by the level they're on

== Floor/Room ==
[https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-fpC9MtpF27A/TzFHoe9XJKI/AAAAAAAAJrM/T8qbxQ_DMvg/s716/room.png]

The pages for floors are very similar to the ones for particular rooms, the only difference being that instead of the *breadcrumbs* that appear on the room page, the floor page only displays the floor number.

*Elements*
  # *Level number* + *breadcrumbs*, in the case of the room page.
  # *Floor map* - for the room page, the particular room is highlighted.
  # *Comment form* - small `textarea` and a `Submit` button.
  # *Comments* - previous comments (text + date posted)

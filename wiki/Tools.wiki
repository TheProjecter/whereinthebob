  Great for wireframes. *Workflow*:
    # grab the wireframe from the repo (if it exists),
    # *import* it in the program,
    # make the changes,
    # *export* to `XML`,
    # *commit* to the repo,
    # *update image* in the documentation, ie. upload new version.

  Pretty good for other types of diagrams (e.g.: `UML` of all sorts). Supports collaborative work.

\begin{abstract}

\textbf{Where in the BOB?} is a simple web application that enables users to
find the location of a room in the Boyd Orr Building. 

The application aims to provide a room search interface to the user.
Results are returned along with a relevant floor plan highlighted to
indicate that room.

Our interface also provides relevant lists of room names in case of an ambiguous 
identifier being passed as a query and the ability comment on a particular room. 

\end{abstract}

\section{Aim of Application}

The application name is ``Where in the BOB'' and its purpose is to provide
students, lecturers and visitors of University of Glasgow with an identifying
system of rooms located in Boyd Orr Building. The application intends to
offer an interface where a user has the option to view a particular 
room from a floor plan perspective, to view details pertaining to that room, and 
leave comments or ratings for it.

The objective, in this case, is to build such a system based on existing 
floor plans of the building. Furthermore, the search facilities are
restricted to a given number of well known room names amongst students
(e.g. Level 3 Computer Science lab) as well as their official names(e.g. Room
720). In this case, if the room is identified, the result of the search will
contain a floor plan with the location of the room highlighted, details
about the room (e.g. number of seats, other details of access, comments on the
room), otherwise it will return a message notifying the user that the search 
process has failed to identify the queried room (i.e. The room was not identified) 
and he will be transfered to the initial page. Here he will insert, besides the tags 
previously used, some new details which are meant to improve the searching.

\subsection{Goals}
The main goal is to provide the user with the intended result to a particular query and 
with a list of room names in case that there are multiple rooms across campus 
especially in the Boyd Orr Building with the same name (e.g Computer Scince Lab).
A particular goal which will provide the user with a consistent and optimized
results is to:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
	\item  search again in case of not found 
	\item  comment on room 
\end{itemize}

We also aim to have a ``leave feedback'' section. This will help us to improve the application
by following the user's demands and concerns.


\subsection{Assumptions}

We made a number of assumptions based on the purpose of this web application. 
It is assumed that users have at least a bare minimum understanding of the English
language and the required skills to utilise a web browser  as well as having 
an Internet connection.

The visual interaction with the application makes it necessary for the user to 
be able to see and to use one hand in order to interact with the device as they 
do with other applications. This include holding a mouse in order to move a 
pointer around the screen or using fingers to point to different parts of the 
screen on touch-screen hand-held devices.

Another assumption we made is that users will be students or visitors with 
minimal knowledge about the campus and they use their hand-held device for 
coordination around campus.

\subsection{Constraints}

\subsubsection{Development constraints}

The major constraint we are concerned about is the time necessary to develop 
the application. We will use the available time during the labs to implement 
the required functionality of our system and we will also make use of Django 
web framework for fast development. Due to budgetary constraints we are forced 
to use open source software which cause another issue in terms of technical 
knowledge regarding the tools used.

\subsubsection{Application constraints}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
	\item \textbf{End-user environment}: The end-user system can be deployed
	on a wide range of devices (e.g. desktop or mobile systems). These devices
	come with a restricted screen size.
	\item \textbf{Network}: The number of simultaneous connection to the server
	might be bounded by the server capabilities.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Functionality}
The required and desired functionality of our application is as follows:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
	\item The required functionality:
	\begin{itemize} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
		\item Accept textual search terms and return results for a searched
		room identifier 
		
		\item Provide a graphical view of the room that is being searched
		within Boyd Orr Building
		
		\item Return an SVG format of the floor plan where the searched
		room is located with the room highlighted
		
		\item Return a list of matching results for ambiguous defined
		identifiers
		
		\item Allow users to leave comments for a the searched room		
	\end{itemize}

	\item The desired functionality:
	\begin{itemize} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
		\item Allow users to see the floor map directory
		\item Allow users to search give feedback on the application
		\item Allow users to return and search for a different room
		\item Allow users to check the accessibility of the room
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Client Interface}

\subsection*{User classes}
This section presents a use case analysis of the website. The use cases 
presented here model the interaction between users and the application.

We have identified the need for two user classes:

\subsubsection*{Visitor}
Visitors are the \textbf{end-users} of the application. They could be either
new students who are not used to the University's campus yet, or anyone else
who can't find their way through the complex system of rooms and hallways that
is the Boyd Orr Building.

\emph{``I'm a level 2 CS student and I can't find my way to the lab. All 
I know is I should be in the \guillemotleft Level 2 lab in the Boyd Orr
\guillemotright. Now, I've managed to find the \textbf{floor}, but I'm not sure
which room I need to go to. Oh,look! There's a room directory up on the wall, 
but it's not very helpful. I sure wish there was an app for this, lol!''}

His goal is to find information regarding a particular room (e.g.: what floor 
it is on, where exactly it is on that floor, etc). He might know the room 
number or some other unofficial name for that room.

They can ask the application about different rooms in the BOB. If that room 
name exists, the app shows an image with the appropriate floor plan and the 
searched room is highlighted.

\subsubsection*{Administrator}
Someone needs to manage all that data, so there will be an administrator. He is
responsible for maintaining the database, ie: adding/removing rooms, floors,
floor plans and the labels for them. They can also edit the comments.

\subsubsection*{User matrix}
The user matrix lists all the functionalities available to each of the user
classes.

\begin{tabular}{| p{4cm} | c | c |} \hline
\textbf{Functionality} & \textbf{Visitor} & \textbf{Admin} \\ \hline
Browse directory & X & X \\ \hline
Search for a room & X & X \\ \hline
Post comment & X & X \\ \hline
Send feedback & X & X \\ \hline
Edit/Delete Comment & & X \\ \hline
Add/edit floor &  & X \\ \hline
Add/edit room & & X \\ \hline
Add/edit floor plan & & X \\ \hline
\end{tabular}	

\subsection*{Walkthrough}
The front page of the app is the ``Home'' page. In order for the users to 
find a room, they can either browse through the ``Rooms and floors
directory'' or they can enter their query in the ``Search box'' provided.

This ``directory'' contains a list of all the existent floors and rooms (each
with link to its own page). While the main functionality of the application is
the ability to search, this directory will also be provided, in case a
user does not know the room by \emph{name}, but knows where the room is \emph{
located}.

By going with the search box, there is a possibility that the room searched by
the user either doesn't exist, or the name is ambiguous, in which case a list
of all the relevant rooms, ie. that are named similarly, is provided.
If there is an exact match, the page for that particular room is displayed.

Once the user gets to a page of a room, a large floor map is provided, with
the searched room being highlighted. All the rooms have labels, so people can
search for the adjacent rooms, once they are on that level.

When clicking on a room area on the floor-plan, a tool-tip appears, showing 
whatever information there is available regarding that room (e.g.: other known
names, type of the room, link to the room's page, etc.). Another option for
displaying this would have been to do it on hovering over that area, but the 
application is also intended to be used with hand-held devices, which have different
pointer behaviours than, say, a desktop PC with a mouse.

\subsection*{Wireframes}
We have tried to design a user interface that is very intuitive, making it
easy for the users to find what they're looking for.

All the pages will have the basic layout of the \textbf{Home} page, which
consists of:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{img/wireframes/home2.png}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
	\item{
		\textbf{Header}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
			\item{
				\textbf{Name} of the website
			}
			\item{
				\textbf{Tagline}/short description of how the application works, so
				the users won't have to go through the tedious process of
				reading through an \textbf{About} page
			}
			\item{
				\textbf{Search box} - this is where the users input their
				query
			}
		\end{enumerate}
	}

	\item{
		\textbf{Content} - the rest of the page will be displayed in this area
				   (i.e. in case of a found instance the floor and the 
				   comments will be displayed; otherwise a list with zero
				   or more elements will be shown)					
	}
	
	\item{\textbf{Footer} - contains the links for the \textbf{navigation menu}
	}
\end{itemize}


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/wireframes/results.png}
\end{center}


The pages \textbf{Results} and \textbf{Directory} share the same design:
a list of all the levels, and for each one of 
them, a list of rooms. If a query returns more than one result, this page is 
shown with the list of matching rooms. In the case of the Directory page, all 
the levels are listed. Their elements are:
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
	\item{\textbf{Query} - the searched term}
	\item{\textbf{Result set} - the results of the query grouped by the level
	they're on}
\end{enumerate}


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{img/wireframes/room.pdf}
\end{center}

The pages for \textbf{floors} are very similar to the ones for particular
\textbf{rooms}, the only difference being that
instead of the breadcrumbs that appear on the room page, the floor page only 
displays the floor number. The structure of these pages:
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
	\item{\textbf{Breadcrumbs} Level number + room number, in the case of 
	the room page.}
	\item{\textbf{Floor map} - for the room page, the particular room is
	highlighted.}
	\item{\textbf{Comment form} - small \texttt{textarea} and a 
	\texttt{Submit} button.}
	\item{\textbf{Comments} - previous comments (text + date posted)}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Technologies}
The client interface uses standard compliant \texttt{HTML} and \texttt{CSS} to
structure and present the information. 


\section{Application Architecture}

\subsection*{N-tier architecture}


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{img/ntier.png}
\end{center}


In order to separate data access, business logic, and presentation from each
other, we have broken our application into 3 logical tiers.

The \textbf{presentation tier} is the topmost layer of the application,
represented by the user interface. It translates user actions into commands
for the application and it presents the information retrieved by the application in a
way that the user can understand.

The \textbf{logic/application tier} is responsible for handling the requests
from the client, and making decisions regarding what information it should
retrieve from the database. It then processes and passes the received data
from the tier beneath it to the one above it.

The \textbf{data tier} is queried by the web server and it responds with the
required information.

\subsection*{ERD}

We have decided to employ a simple object to table mapping scheme to facilitate
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), operations on our data which fits in with 
our framework MVC paradigm.

\subsubsection{Entity description}
The Floor entity has the purpose to identify the rest of the entities through 
a correlated set of floors and moreover, comments on these floors.\\
\\
The Room\_Name and the Room\_Type objects map the registered names and type 
of each room in database. The purpose of these table is to minimize the 
redundancy and dependency in the Room table. Having a normalized relational 
database table was our main concern in increasing the performance and efficiency 
of our application.\\
\\
The Comment entity mainly stores the users inputs for each floor and room and 
maps these instances to each of the mentioned objects.


\subsubsection{Cardinality}
A room is associated with a Room\_Type. The assumption is that each room
has one intitled purpose and only one (i.e a lab is not a toilet nor a kitchen).
The relation between the Room and the Room\_Name is one to many mainly 
because this is the assumption we made in order to meed the requirements
stated in the first part of this document. A room will be uniquely identified 
by the Room\_ID, but it occur several times in our database with different 
names.\\
\\
The floor will contain a set of comments which is initialized every time when 
you visit the floor plan with the collection of comments for each room. The 
room object can have 0 or multiple objects . These will be added by users after 
a search has been completed. The main idea is for user to identify the room, 
then insert comments on that particular room.\\
\\
The floor, in terms of components, will be a set of room instances. A floor 
can have 0 or more rooms, where as a room must be part of the floor object.\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Message Passing}


WhereInTheBob is a fully standards compliant web application.
Since our requirenments are fairly standard , a mix of openly supported 
technologies will be employed:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
\item \textbf{ Client to Server } requests and responses are HTTP.
\\ A mix of POST and GET requests will be employed. 
	\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
		\item \textbf{POST} requests will be used for sensitive data such as 
		``Username'' and ``Password'' strings
		to avoid leaving personally identifiable information behind in places
		such as the browser's url history.
		\item \textbf{GET} requests with parameters will be used in the
		``floor'' and ``room'' lookup requests. 
	\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Server to Data Store } communications will be handled trough standards SQL queries.
The underlying protocol will differ in our development and production servers
as SQLite is easier to use in a development environment (local api calls ). \\
\\
In an production environment however the standard MySql connection protocol will
be used.
\end{itemize}
Our chosen framework, Django supports all of these technologies and protocols
natively. The protocols themselves are wildly popular and so we will not discuss
them any further.

% WE DON'T NEED THIS ANYMORE

%\section{Summary and Future Work}
%\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
%	\item Extend the database to support the rest of the University's campus;
%	\item The system could also be used in libraries, supermarkets, and other
%	public locations.

\section{Design revision / feedback}

In terms of clarity of the content, all the reviewers have concluded that our 
specification report was clearly written and easy to understand. Although, it 
was stated some parts of the report could have been explained better.\\
\\
Regarding the Diagrams section, four reviewers acknowledged the entire set of 
diagrams and one observed that one of the diagrams are missing.  We checked the 
report with our tutor and we enumerated all the present diagrams and we decided 
that no diagram is missing and we took no further action concerning adding a new 
one. At this stage we wished we had the reviewer's comment about which particular 
diagram is missing.\\
\\
The answers received for the Messaging/Sequence Diagram were split between: (1) 
messages ordered correctly and the flow of message are appropriate and (2) there 
are couple of messages missing or the ordering of one message is out. \\
The Wireframes was one of the most disputed sections. Despite that most of the 
reviewers agreed on being clearly labeled and the layout is justified. One of 
the wireframes was showing a different map rather than  a floor plan. The 
reason for this is that we didn't had the floor maps when we wrote the report.\\
\\
The comments received on the Diagrams were unclear and ambiguous and in some cases 
wrong. We selected some of relevant ones and we changed the bits that needed the 
improvement. The explanation of the content on the Home page was improved, on more 
layer for the user was added in the sequence diagram and the requests from the 
user were made clearer as well as a paragraph explaining the messages.\\
\\
Regarding the Thoughtfulness of the Design all the reviewers stated that 
the design is well thought. Moreover, some of them felt that the objectives 
are not going to be met.\\
\\
The observations made on the Comments and Suggested Changes section are all 
towards the fact that the application is well thought, simple and useful in 
real world. The fact the user interface is simple and intuitive and the use 
of maps outlined the main idea of all the good comments received. The feeling 
given by the comments is that the reviewers didn't well read the report. Some 
of the questions they raised were already answered in report and some of them 
didn't made any sense regarding the purpose of this report, assignment or 
course: ``if the team were to expand the website ... then the website's 
name may need to be changed.''\\
\\
\\
Furthermore, we acknowledged the suggestions we have received on this report 
and we tried to conform for the final one. A section with the technologies 
used has been added as well as a section explaining the alternatives we have 
exploit other than WAF and Django.The overall rating of the design have been 
set to the level of pretty clear and clearly thought out. From the Clients 
Perspective all of the reviewers are very impressed and they thought that the 
document looks professional and communicates the needs very well.  The overall 
rating from a Boss' Perspective was outstanding in our case. All the reviewers 
have picked the Good Work answer.\\

\section{Implementation notes}

\subsection{Views}

\textbf{Directory/ - Directory of rooms and floors}\\
This view displays a list of rooms and floors the user thereby  implementing the Browser Functionality.\\
\\     
\textbf{Floor/ - Display Floor Details}\\
This view  displays the floor plan and associated comments for a particular room passed in by id.\\
\\              
\textbf{Room/ - Display Room Details}\\
This view  displays the floor plan with the specific room
highligthed for quick identification by the user as well as the
room specific comments left by other users.\\
\\
\textbf{Search/ - Displays a list of search results or redirects to a specific room}\\
This view displays a list of rooms , an error message or redirectos to
 a Room/ view in the case that a single room has been returned from the search\\
\\ 
                                          
As the application is dedicated to a single highly specialized task our URL Mapping Schema
is a one-to-one mapping of the relative path and view name. As an example , accesing the 
search functionality is as siple as accesing the /search URL.\\
\\                                        
Having all the requred data contained within our own Database , no external services are required or used.
As a future development , user authentication might be handled by an external LDAP server or similar.
